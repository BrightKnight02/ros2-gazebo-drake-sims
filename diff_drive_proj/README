## Requirements

Drake, ROS2 Humble Distribution, C++20 or higher, Python3.10 or higher, Ignition Gazebo Fortress 

Make sure to source workspace to allow for ros2 discovery.

Change path for SDF model in launch file to match your own, copy is put into repo for reference.

## Launch

Project launched by going into launch folder and running `ros2 launch robot_drive_launch.py`

## Nodes

Bridge bridges topics between Ignition Gazebo and ROS2.
Controller node sends angular velocities and contains PID controllers to adjust velocities given the positions of vehicle. 
Trajectory server as endpoint of trajectory, just a simple service that returns the next point in a sequence given a current point. Generated from trajectory. 

## Parameters
 
Robot wheel parameters can be changed, the trajectory variables can also be modified along with points and many other things. Check constructor for more details.
